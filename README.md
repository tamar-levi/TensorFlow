Welcome to my repository showcasing the practical projects and experiments I completed as part of the **TensorFlow course** at **OpenCV University**. This journey has been one of deep learning – literally and figuratively – filled with challenges, breakthroughs, and a ton of coffee ☕.

## 📚 Course Background

The **TensorFlow course** was an intensive, hands-on learning experience designed to provide a strong foundation in:

* Neural Networks & Deep Learning
* Computer Vision with TensorFlow
* Model Optimization and Deployment
* Real-world AI applications using OpenCV integrations

Throughout the course, I immersed myself in both theory and practical exercises, focusing on building models from scratch and training them on custom datasets.

## 💡 What You'll Find Here

This repository contains a curated collection of the projects I built, trained, and tested during and after the course:

### 🧠 Key Projects:

* **Image Classification** – Custom CNNs trained on CIFAR-10 & flower datasets.
* **Object Detection** – Real-time bounding box detection using TensorFlow Lite.
* **Digit Recognition App** – Handwritten digit classifier using a live webcam feed.
* **Style Transfer** – Neural network that paints your photo like Van Gogh.
* **Pose Estimation** – Track and estimate human poses in real-time with MediaPipe + TF.

Each project reflects a stage in my learning process, from understanding the basics of tensors to deploying lightweight models in edge environments.

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies

* TensorFlow 2.x
* Keras
* OpenCV
* NumPy / Pandas / Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebooks & Google Colab
* TensorBoard for visualization
* TensorFlow Lite for edge deployment

## 🌱 Growth Through Effort

This journey wasn’t just about writing code—it was about:

* **Perseverance**: debugging stubborn layers and tuning hyperparameters late into the night.
* **Curiosity**: experimenting with model architectures and understanding why things work (or don’t).
* **Creativity**: blending CV techniques with deep learning to produce artistic and functional results.

> Each commit in this repo is a reflection of the effort and passion I put into this learning journey.
